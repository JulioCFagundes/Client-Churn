THE PROBLEM:

Churn is nothing more than a metric that represents the loss of customers in a business/company.
e.g. the percentage of customers who stop using the products or a company's services for a certain period of time. 

For a company, having knowledge about clients churn ÃÅis of paramount importance, because the loss of customers have a significant impact on their profits and growth, so having this 
knowledge in hands they can use different approaches to retain the customers (if it is worth).

STRUCTURE:

Here in this project we have 3 files:

  * Client_Churn_Notebook_Script.ipynb and Customer Churn Script.py:
      - These two files have the same content in different formats
      - It's important to say that it's a technical analysis and not something that should be presented (this way) for a manager or someone not familiarized with this terms.
      - These files contains exploratory analysis, data processing, feature management, 4 models (KNN, Nayve Bayes, Random Forest and XGBoost) and confusion matrix.
   
  * Client_Churn_Results_Demonstration.pdf
      - This pdf is a report that contains all the project steps explained.
      - There you will find:
